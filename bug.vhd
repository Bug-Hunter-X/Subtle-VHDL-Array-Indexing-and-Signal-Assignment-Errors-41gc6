In VHDL, a common yet subtle error involves incorrect handling of array indexing, particularly when dealing with signals or variables declared as arrays.  Off-by-one errors frequently occur when accessing the first or last element of an array.  Another issue arises when attempting to read from or write to an array index that's out of bounds, leading to unpredictable behavior or simulation crashes.  For instance, if an array is declared with a range of 0 to 9, attempting to access index 10 would be erroneous.  Additionally, improper use of signal assignments within loops can create unintended race conditions or glitches.  A classic example of this could be attempting to modify an array element within a process based on the current value of the same array element within the same process, leading to unpredictable behavior.
