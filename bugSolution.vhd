The corrected code in `bugSolution.vhd` addresses these errors by carefully checking array bounds before accessing elements, using appropriate array ranges, and restructuring signal assignments within loops to eliminate race conditions.  For instance, instead of directly modifying an array element based on its current value within the same process, an intermediate signal is employed to hold the new value, which is then assigned to the array element after the loop completes.  This prevents unexpected or inaccurate values from being used within the same iteration of the loop.
